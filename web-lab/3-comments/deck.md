## Part 3 - The Full-Stack comments

In this part, we are going to code fullstack web-component to allow people to comment our blog posts ğŸ’¬

### Webcomponents

- Set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps
- Can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML
- Made up of 4 W3C specification standards

-- 

- **Custom Elements** -> creating and using new types of DOM elements.
- **Shadow DOM** -> Encapsulate style and markup in web components.
- **ES Modules** -> Inclusion and reuse of JS documents in a standards based, modular, performant way.
- **HTML Template** -> Declare fragments of markup that go unused at page load, but can be instantiated later on at runtime.
